# SustenTyres Landing Page

## Project Overview

This project is a responsive webpage built with HTML and CSS Grid, adapted from my previous project "landing-page-template." SustenTyres is a fictional brand created to simulate a real company website, aiming to provide an immersive experience of how real businesses operate and manage their logistics.

The site was developed as part of a high school workshop, where it was presented and used by over 20 users. The project received top marks for creativity and execution.

## Features
- Responsive layout using CSS Grid
- Modern, clean design
- Multiple sections: About, Services, Gallery, and Contact
- Interactive navigation menu
- Image gallery and social media links

## Educational Purpose
The main goal of this project was to enhance immersion and understanding of real-world business operations and logistics in an educational context. It served as a practical example during a classroom workshop, helping students experience the process of creating a professional company.
